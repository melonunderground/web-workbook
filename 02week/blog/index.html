      <p>Today, SXSW announced its feature films lineup for the 2018 festival, taking place March 9th-18th in Austin, Texas. Some of the major titles right off the bat include the premieres of John Krasinski’s thriller A Quiet Place, the Leslie Mann/Ike Barinholtz/John Cena comedy Blockers, and 130 more features over 10 days. A who’s-who of compelling indie filmmakers will also debut new work, such as Lynn Shelton, Spike Lee, Andrew Bujalski, and Jody Hill, alongside already-premiered films by Ethan Hawke, Bo Burnham, the Zellner brothers, and many more.

    <p>Despite being nominated for Album of the Year, Lorde is not scheduled to perform at the Grammys. The reason, according to Variety? Grammys organizers approached Lorde about performing with other artists but not solo, possibly as part of a Tom Petty tribute. She declined the offer. Meanwhile, the other Album of the Year candidates, all of who are male, were reportedly offered solo spots.

Lorde’s mother, Sonja Yelich, seemingly confirmed the slight. She posted a photo of a New York Times article about the Grammys’ lack of diversity which also noted that her daughter was not scheduled to perform. “This says it all,” Sonja Yelich captioned the photo.
